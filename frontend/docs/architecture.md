# Project Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the architecture of the Resume Builder Monorepo project. The project is divided into several key areas, each with its own responsibilities and components.

## Frontend

The frontend of the project is built using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. The frontend is responsible for the user interface and user experience of the application.

### Key Technologies

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **shadcn/ui**: A component library for building user interfaces.
- **NextAuth.js**: A library for authentication in Next.js applications.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

### Key Components

- **LoginForm**: A form for user login with validation.
- **RegistrationForm**: A form for user registration with password strength validation.
- **AuthContext**: A context provider for managing authentication state.
- **ProtectedRoutes**: Middleware for protecting routes that require authentication.
- **ResumeList**: A component for displaying a list of resumes with pagination.
- **ResumeCard**: A component for displaying individual resume cards with an actions menu.
- **CreateResumeModal**: A modal form for creating new resumes.
- **SortingFilteringControls**: Controls for sorting and filtering resumes.
- **ResumeEditor**: A component for editing resumes with dynamic form sections, real-time preview synchronization, template selection, color palette customization, PDF export, and auto-save debounce logic.

## Backend

The backend of the project is built using NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. The backend is responsible for handling API requests, authentication, and database operations.

### Key Technologies

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building server-side applications.
- **Prisma**: An ORM for interacting with the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database management system.
- **Argon2**: A password hashing algorithm.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication.

### Key Components

- **AuthController**: A controller for handling authentication-related requests.
- **AuthService**: A service for managing authentication logic.
- **PrismaService**: A service for interacting with the Prisma ORM.
- **ResumeController**: A controller for handling resume-related requests.
- **ResumeService**: A service for managing resume-related logic.

## Shared

The shared directory contains code that is used by both the frontend and backend of the project. This includes DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), types, and utility functions.

### Key Components

- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for validating and transferring data between the frontend and backend.
- **Types**: TypeScript types for ensuring type safety across the project.
- **Validation**: Utility functions for validating data.

## DevOps

The DevOps setup for the project includes Docker for containerization, Vercel for frontend deployment, and various tools for monitoring and health checks.

### Key Technologies

- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Vercel**: A platform for frontend deployment.
- **Sentry**: A tool for monitoring and error tracking.
- **OpenTelemetry**: A set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to provide observability.

## Documentation

The documentation for the project includes an API reference, development environment guide, contribution guidelines, and a deployment playbook.

### Key Documents

- **API Reference**: Documentation of the API endpoints and their usage.
- **Development Environment Guide**: Instructions for setting up the development environment.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Guidelines for contributing to the project.
- **Deployment Playbook**: Instructions for deploying the project to production.

## Quality Assurance

The quality assurance setup for the project includes end-to-end test scenarios, load testing, accessibility audits, cross-browser testing, and security audits.

### Key Technologies

- **Vitest**: A testing framework for unit and component tests.
- **Playwright**: A framework for end-to-end testing.
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: A tool for mocking API requests.
- **OWASP**: A checklist for security audits.

## Deployment

The deployment setup for the project includes configuration for Vercel, NestJS server deployment, database backup strategy, and rollback procedures.

### Key Technologies

- **Vercel**: A platform for frontend deployment.
- **NestJS**: A framework for backend deployment.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database management system.

## Phase 2 Features

The project has several planned features for phase 2, including resume sharing, multi-language support, AI-assisted content suggestions, a template marketplace, and an analytics dashboard.

### Key Features

- **Resume Sharing**: View-only links for sharing resumes.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Support for multiple languages.
- **AI-Assisted Content Suggestions**: AI-powered suggestions for resume content.
- **Template Marketplace**: A marketplace for resume templates.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: A dashboard for viewing analytics related to resumes.
